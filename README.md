Region -Based Segmentation - Implementing thresholding in Image segmentation.

This project aims to look out how region based segmentation works such that objects are segmented using their pixel values. 
We then set a threshold value where the pixel values falling below or above that thresholdcan be classified as an object or the background.
This project utilizes a global threshold because the image used will be divided into two regions(object and background), hence the need to define a single threshold value.
